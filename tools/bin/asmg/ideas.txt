=====
There some ambiguity with Rn, A, B, C (It would be nice if they could be both special arguments (that are for new instructions), as well as 
direct addresses.(However, if i support using them as both Special ops, and direct addresses, there might be a problem
with compatibility
)

Should be a flag, whether to use them as special or not.

For now, it is certainly easier to leave them as special operands

so some keywords will be interpreted as DirectAddresses, and others as special operands, such as AOperand


Future:
	for mov, and other instructions that can take a direct, or have special operands as well, allow both
	maybe just create duplicate signatures (simplest) (seems to be best)
	or create a new Operand type (Register) that will be handle by mov (and others?),  (seems questionable, and too complex)
	
TODO:
	Make operands for special symbols
	Deal with direct/bit name synonyms 
	
	make parser a bit cleaner? (so different operand categories are handle without nasty ifs)
	
	(so basically, finish operand parsing, then the rest is easy)
	
	except maybe pseudo-ops
	
	also thing about code segmenting and two passes
